# Chops a branch containing a single commit into multiple branches, by
# file path.
#
# When working on very large, complex changes, it's sometimes best to
# split up the work into multiple branches. git-hatchet helps to do that.
#
# git-hatchet takes a branch name and a set of file paths. The specified
# files paths affected in the branch's top-most commit will be pulled out of
# that commit and placed as a new commit in the current branch.
#
# By passing --extract-only, the original commit will not be modified.
#
# For example, given a branch 'orig-branch' that contains a HEAD commit
# modifying files in docs/manual, files in docs/releasenotes/, files in
# src/, and a top-level README:
#
#    $ git checkout -b my-new-branch
#    $ git hatchet orig-branch docs/manual README
#
# This will result in the original commit no longer modifying README or any
# files in docs/manual, but retaining the changes in src/ and
# docs/releasenotes. It will also result in a new commit in the current branch
# containing the modifications to README and files in docs/manual.
#
# This is not a commonly-needed operation, but when you do need it,
# git-hatchet is a major time-saver.
